# Intearactive cv for devs in html

## About Project 
Initially created as the way to extend my cv one weekend. Later i thought maybe someone else could run into the same problem so i will leave it here just in case. Looks quite nice on pc and mobile. Easily adaptable and extremely lightweight.

I recomend using liveserver with plugged in phone.

You can easly forwar port using command.
```

```
